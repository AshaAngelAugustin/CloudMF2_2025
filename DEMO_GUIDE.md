## 📋 Quick Overview
**Project:** Database Converter Web Application  
**Duration:** 2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate SQL script conversion between Oracle, SQL Server, and Sybase  

---

## 🎯 Demo Script (2 Minutes)

### **Opening (0-15 seconds)**
> "Hello! I'm excited to demonstrate our Database Converter - a modern web application that transforms SQL scripts between Oracle, SQL Server, and Sybase databases instantly. Let me show you how it works."

### **UI Overview (15-30 seconds)**
> "As you can see, we have a beautiful, modern interface with gradient design and professional styling. The tool is simple to use - just three steps: upload your file, select target database, and convert!"

### **File Upload Demo (30-45 seconds)**
> "First, I'll upload a sample SQL file. I'm selecting our test file 'sample_mixed.sql' which contains mixed database syntax - perfect for demonstrating the conversion capabilities. The file contains both Oracle and SQL Server syntax that needs to be standardized."

### **Conversion Process (45-75 seconds)**
> "Now I'll select Oracle as my target database format. When I click 'Convert File'... And there we go! The conversion is complete instantly. 
> 
> Look at this amazing comparison view - on the left is our original mixed syntax, and on the right is the clean, Oracle-compatible code. Notice how:
> - VARCHAR became VARCHAR2
> - GETDATE() was changed to SYSDATE  
> - IDENTITY became Oracle's GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY"

### **Features Highlight (75-105 seconds)**
> "The changes summary shows exactly what transformations were made - 8 different changes in this case. This transparency helps developers understand exactly what the tool modified.
> 
> The side-by-side comparison makes it easy to review changes before using the converted code in your database environment."

### **Download & Conclusion (105-120 seconds)**
> "Finally, I can download the converted file with a click. The tool automatically names it with the target database format.
> 
> This Database Converter saves hours of manual syntax conversion work and ensures accuracy when migrating between database platforms. Thank you!"
