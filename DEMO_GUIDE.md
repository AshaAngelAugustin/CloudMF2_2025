**Duration:** 2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate SQL script conversion between Oracle, SQL Server, and Sybase  

---

## 🎯 Demo Script (2 Minutes)

### **Opening (0-15 seconds)**
> "Hello! I'm excited to demonstrate our Enterprise Database Converter - a powerful web application that transforms SQL scripts AND stored procedures between Oracle, SQL Server, and Sybase databases instantly. This tool handles everything from basic SQL to complex stored procedures!"

### **UI Overview (15-30 seconds)**
> "As you can see, we have a beautiful, modern interface with gradient design and professional styling. The tool accepts SQL files, text files, and CSV files - just three steps: upload your file, select target database, and convert!"

### **File Upload Demo (30-45 seconds)**
> "First, I'll upload our comprehensive test file 'mixed_sql_and_procedures.txt' which contains both basic SQL statements AND a complete stored procedure - perfect for demonstrating our enterprise-level conversion capabilities."

### **Conversion Process (45-75 seconds)**
> "Now I'll select Oracle as my target database format. When I click 'Convert File'... And there we go! The conversion is complete instantly. 
> 
> Look at this amazing transformation - our converter has intelligently handled BOTH the basic SQL syntax AND completely converted the stored procedure structure! Notice how:
> - The stored procedure syntax was converted to Oracle PL/SQL format
> - Variable declarations became Oracle-compliant
> - Loop constructs were transformed to Oracle syntax
> - Data types like CHAR and INT were converted to VARCHAR2 and NUMBER"

### **Features Highlight (75-105 seconds)**
> "The changes summary shows exactly what transformations were made - over 10 different enterprise-level changes! This includes stored procedure structure conversion, parameter handling, cursor syntax transformation, and data type mapping.
> 
> This isn't just basic syntax conversion - this is full enterprise stored procedure migration between database platforms!"

### **Download & Conclusion (105-120 seconds)**
> "Finally, I can download the converted file with a click. The tool automatically names it with the target database format.
> 
> This Database Converter saves hours of manual syntax conversion work and ensures accuracy when migrating between database platforms. Thank you!"
